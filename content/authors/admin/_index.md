Hey, This is SaiSriTeja, I have done my B.Tech(2021 Batch) at SASTRA University. Despite being doing my undergrad in Electronics and Communication engineering, I have completed, courses in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Robotics by hands-on practice approach, that has provided me with a firm understanding of rising market strategies and technologies.
My interests include the fields of Medical Technologies, Machine learning, Robotics and Neuroscience.
I am currently working as a project engineer at Healthcare Technology Innovation Center, IIT-Madras Research Park in Spine Surgical Robotics team.
